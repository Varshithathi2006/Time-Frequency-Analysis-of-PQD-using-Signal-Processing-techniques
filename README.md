## 🧠 Introduction

Power Quality Disturbances (PQDs) such as harmonics, flicker, sag, and interruptions impact grid stability and equipment efficiency. To address this, we used time-frequency analysis methods to study the non-stationary characteristics of these disturbances.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply **Advanced Signal Processing Techniques** for analyzing PQDs and generate comprehensive time-frequency representations that allow accurate identification of various fault types.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### Techniques Implemented:

1. **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**
2. **Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT)**
3. **Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD)**
4. **Variational Mode Decomposition + Teager Energy Operator (VMD-TEO)**
5. **Fourier Synchrosqueezing Transform (FSST)**

### Data Flow:

- Signals collected representing different PQDs (e.g., flicker, notch, sag, swell, interruptions)
- Each method applied to analyze time-frequency behavior
- Comparisons made on localization accuracy and clarity

## 📊 Results & Observations

- **FSST**: High localization, superior in identifying transient changes
- **STFT**: Good resolution, but lacks sharpness
- **HHT**: Detailed info, suffers from mode mixing
- **SPWVD**: Reduced interference, less intuitive interpretation
- **VMD-TEO**: Highlights transients, less refined visually

### PQD Types Detected:

- Sinewave
- Flicker
- Notch
- Harmonics
- Sag
